<p>Here we are again, story time with JavaScript and HTML!!!</p>
<p>This week's story is another homage to my son's adventuring tales. I've also thrown in some references to Community, D&D, and Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be a Hero? (despite trademark lawsuits I can't bring myself to call it Quest for Glory).</p>
<p>I'll be exploring more advanced JavaScript concepts like objects and JSON data this week.</p>
